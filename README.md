# Tristans-Version-Control
Routinely backs up files and notifies when specified programs are opened. More Auto-Backup than version control but this name sounds cooler.
### Why does this Exist?
My good old pal Grant is an animator, but there was a a pretty big issue. The program he used would inconsistently crash, causing the project file to become corrupt and unusable. This wasted a lot of time and work, so I made this thing to constantly keep historical versions of his project files. This meant X minutes of work gone now instead of 10 hours when it decided to crash. He would also forget to turn it on so the program runs in the background and notifies him when he opens his animation program.
